<p>Having practiced since 5th grade, I was excited to start my first development job
    as a college sophomore. Southwest Airlines contracted me to maintain a
    legacy internal safety reporting application. It was not glamorous but seldom
    is a junior developers first assignment. After eight
    months, my consulting company promoted me to Technical Lead. The next
    two years were spent working beside new developers helping them succeed.
</p>

<p>Since then, I've had the opportunity to work with a variety of teams, technologies, and
    companies from legacy monoliths to decoupled microservices, young teams to
    experienced teams, start ups to corporations, contractors to employees, scrum,
    waterfall, scrumfall, you name it. My goal is to use those experiences to contribute
    back to the developer community in the same way it has contributed to me.

    <p>Tsugi is a language for the Java Virtual Machine. The design intent is to solve several
        of the issues developers hold against the Java language such as verbosity and bulkiness.
        However, my goal is to learn more about developer experience, compilers,
        and the JVM.

    <p>The developer I am today is largely accredited to the developer community
        making itself available to me. In the same way, I want to contribute back
        to that community. Recently, I launched my blog to share what I have learned
        and continue to learn about developing software.
