# Introduction
Software Development is arguably one of the most rapidly changing fields today.
We are constantly developing new ways of doing things. It is also one of
the fastest growing fields to date. Estimates suggest that the number of developers
is doubling ever five years. That leaves half of all developers with less than
five years of experience. What do we get when we combine a lack of experience
with the constant releasing of new methods and technologies? You guessed it, buzzwords!   

The software industry is fantastic at creating and promoting buzzwords; machine learning,
blockchain, agile, Docker, scrum, artificial intelligence, microservices, serverless,
cloud, domain driven design, continuous delivery, and DevOps. None of these things
are inheritly wrong. They are all do a great job at solving specific problems but
have been overloaded with tremendous hype.
