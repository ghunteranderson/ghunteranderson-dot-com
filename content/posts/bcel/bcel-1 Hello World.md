# 1. Introduction
With BCEL, we can create new Java code from an existing Java application. In
this article, we will look at how to create a Hello World program
using BCEL to write the compiled byte code to memory. Then we will load the
synthetic class into the JVM and execute our generated code.

# 2. Creating a new class
```java
public class SyntaxHighlightingTest {
  public static void main(String[] args){
    System.out.println("Hello World");
  }
}
```
# 3. Adding a new method

# 4. Executing the synthetic class

# 5. Conclusion
